# Intel-Image-Classificatio
Course: Deep Learning; Involved models: CNN
This is a project that classify the dataset Intel Image Classification (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification).
Random search was applied to tune the hyperparamters: the CNN architecture, regularizers.
Transfer learning was applied. A pre-trained VGG16 model with self-defined fully-connected layers resulted in improving from the baseline model.
Check the details in the report.
